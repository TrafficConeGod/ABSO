# Sunshine Odyssey
Sunshine Odyssey is a reboot/spinoff of ROBLOX Odyssey that is meant to give some sort of conclusion to an otherwise cancelled project.
Sunshine Odyssey is completely open source and free to modify if you please.

## Set up
For easy set up you will need [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Rojo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evaera.vscode-rojo).
After downloading both of those you will then need to go into the Rojo settings in VS Code and toggle the plugin management setting, along with setting the release branch to the latest version.
Next you'll need to open up Roblox Studio and create a new place. Delete everything in the workspace then in VS Code click on Start Rojo, go back to Roblox Studio and in the plugins tab click on rojo and in the widget that opens click connect!

That should be the end of it but unfortunately due to some issues Roblox still hasn't fixed you'll have to drag the costumes.rbxm, frames.rbxm, and models.rbxm into the Assets folder into Roblox Studio. After doing this everything should be working!

## Sunshine Suite
After finishing the set up you can go into ServerStorage and right click on the folder called Suite, then click on Save as Local Plugin and click save. This will install the editor plugin for Sunshine Odyssey!
